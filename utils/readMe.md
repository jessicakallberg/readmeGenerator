# ReadMe Generator

## Description
This readme generator is an application that can be used to quickly put together a readme.md.  Without having to worry about the proper questions or markdown language.  This application will autogenerate this automatically for you.  I did struggle with the proper coding to generate a badge.  In the future I'd like to go back to this project and complete this.
